# FEWD_Project
30 Acres School: Rachel's Code Louisville FEWD project

For my project, I made a mock-up of a landing page for a Facebook friend who is forming a micro-school. I used content from her Facebook group and organized it into a simple landing page. I wanted to keep things simple and earthy with a back-to-the-basics style that captures the feel of children learning on a small farm.

My goal is to keep working on this to improve the design, maybe by digging deeper into CSS grid or Bootstrap. I have learned a lot in the past 12 weeks -- thank you, Code Louisville!
