30 Acres School: Rachel's Code Louisville FEWD project

For my project, I made a mock-up of a landing page for a Facebook friend who is forming a micro-school. I took content from her Facebook group and organized it into a simple landing page. I wanted to keep things simple and earthy with a back-to-the-basics style that captures the feel of children learning on a small farm.
