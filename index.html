  <div class="about">
      <h2 id="about">Character forged through learning</h2>
      <p>Some might call us a <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/future-of-school/agile-in-education-an-intro-to-micro-schooling-c508c3bbc367">micro-school</a>. <strong>We call ourselves 30 Acres: a one-room schoolhouse nestled in the farmlands of Elizabeth, Indiana.</strong></p>
        <p>
        Bible, good literature, Latin, mathematics, learning facts (Bible, history, etc.) in fun ways through music, art, story and drama, science with hands-on activities, penmanship -- yes, even cursive will be introduced and taught!  
        Classical approach with a Charlotte Mason twist.  Balance.</p> 
        </p>

      <h2 id="learning">Latin is alive, and so is learning.</h2>
      <p><strong>Classical. Christian. Eclectic.</strong></p>
      <p>Searching for options in educating your child? Our community is a unique school setting on 30 acres of rejuvenated teaching farmland.
        Recess will never be the same. Learn that Latin is most definitely alive. History is best taught through story. The young child is equipped to memorize facts. Math facts. History dates. Parts and Places.
        Good literature that inspires great character. Speaking skills. Hands-on activities. Animal study. Shakespeare.
        Art and music as a conduit to deeper learning within other subjects but also within curriculum to be discussed as an academic which deepens the process called thinking.
